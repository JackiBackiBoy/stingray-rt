<p align="center">GPU-accelerated real-time path tracer powered by VulkanÂ® and C++.</p>
<h1 align="center"></h1>

Stingray is a real-time path tracer leveraging the Vulkan ray tracing pipeline. Delivering high-fidelity graphics with a minimalistic and efficient design philosophy in mind.

# Features
- **Fully bindless resources:** Buffers, images, and acceleration structures are efficiently managed without the constraints of fixed bindings, enabling maximum flexibility in rendering pipelines.
- **Fully path traced:** Includes physically accurate shadows, reflections, refraction, and global illumination.
- **Lean and mean:** Very minimal and clean abstraction layer over both Vulkan and the rendering hardware interface (RHI).
  Stingray makes very little use of OOP design patterns, opting instead for a data-driven approach with POD types.
- **Automatic GPU synchronization:** Stingray utilizes a render graph to manage resource barriers between passes, ensuring efficient execution.

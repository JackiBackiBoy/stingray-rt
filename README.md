<p align="center">GPU-accelerated real-time path tracer powered by VulkanÂ® and C++.</p>
<h1 align="center"></h1>

Stingray is a real-time path tracer leveraging the Vulkan ray tracing pipeline. Delivering high-fidelity graphics with a minimalistic and efficient design philosophy in mind.

# Features
- **Fully bindless resources:** Buffers, images, and acceleration structures are efficiently managed without the constraints of fixed bindings, enabling maximum flexibility in rendering pipelines.
- **Fully path traced:** Includes physically accurate shadows, reflections, refraction, and global illumination.
- **Lean and mean:** Very minimal and clean abstraction layer over both Vulkan and the rendering hardware interface (RHI).
  Stingray makes very little use of OOP design patterns, opting instead for a data-driven approach with POD types.
- **Automatic GPU synchronization:** Stingray utilizes a render graph to manage resource barriers between passes, ensuring efficient execution.

# Building
## Prerequisites
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) version 1.3 or higher.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.6 or higher.
- Windows 10 or higher.
- Microsoft Visual Studio.
- GPU with hardware ray tracing support.

## Build Instructions
In order for all dependencies to be downloaded with the project, you must recursively clone this repo via:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JackiBackiBoy/stingray-rt 
```

Once downloaded, run the `build.bat` script which will automatically create a `build` directory. Or alternatively run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S ../ -B .
cd ..
```

You will also need to compile the Vulkan shaders, which are not automatically compiled. Run the `compile_vk_shaders.bat` script.
You can now open the `.sln` project file located in the `build` directory with Microsoft Visual Studio. Also remember to set
`stingray` as the "Startup Project" in Visual Studio. This can be done by right-clicking the
stingray project and select the option "Set as Startup Project".

You should now be able to run the program!
